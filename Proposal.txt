PROJECT NAME:

"Memoree" or "Forget me Not!"; needs something catchy

GOAL:

A desktop application for Windows to make setting reminders simple!

MVP:

• Create a reminder with a set date & time
• Fire desktop notifications for reminders when they're due
• Delete reminders
• Edit the details of reminders
• Display all active reminders in a list/grid or some kind of view

STUFF FOR MVP:

• Visual Studio
• .NET Core
• ASP .NET
• C#
• SQL

EXTRAS:

• Program runs in the background
• Downloadable program installer
• Duplicate reminders
• Reminder snoozing (resend reminder notification after x duration)
• Reminder repeating (repeat reminder every x duration/time)
• Option to skip next notification for a repeating reminder
• Instead of specifying date/time, can use relative time (eg. remind me in 5 hours)
• Customizable sound effect/ringtone for when reminders fire
• Use Google's API for Google Calendar for option to sync events to allow making reminders for calendar events

STUFF FOR EXTRAS:

• IExpress or 7-Zip to create the installer package, there are many options for this
• Google Calendar API

ADDITIONAL INFO:

• SQL will be used to store the data for each reminder
• Visual Studio seems to be required for this to be done in a more efficient way, as it has built-in tools geared towards creating Windows Forms (essentially that's what a basic Windows program is)
